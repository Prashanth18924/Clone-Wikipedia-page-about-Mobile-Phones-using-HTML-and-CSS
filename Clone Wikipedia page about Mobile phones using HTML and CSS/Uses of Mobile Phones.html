        <h1>Uses of Mobile Phones</h1>
        <p>Mobile phones are used for a variety of purposes, such as keeping in touch with family
            members, for conducting business, and in order to have access to a telephone in the event of an
            emergency. Some people carry more than one mobile phone for different purposes, such as for
            business and personal use. Multiple SIM cards may be used to take advantage of the benefits of
            different calling plans. For example, a particular plan might provide for cheaper local calls, longdistance
            calls, international calls, or roaming.</p>

            <li>A study by Motorola found that one in
                ten mobile phone subscribers have a
                second phone that is often kept secret
                from other family members. These
                phones may be used to engage in such
                activities as extramarital affairs or
                clandestine business dealings.</li>
            <li>Some organizations assist victims of
                domestic violence by providing mobile
                phones for use in emergencies. These
                are often refurbished phones.</li>
            <li>The advent of widespread textmessaging
                has resulted in the cell
                phone novel, the first literary genre to
                emerge from the cellular age, via text
                messaging to a website that collects the
                novels as a whole</li>
            <li>Mobile telephony also facilitates
                activism and citizen journalism.</li>
            <li>The United Nations reported that mobile
                phones have spread faster than any
                other form of technology and can
                improve the livelihood of the poorest
                people in developing countries, by
                providing access to information in
                places where landlines or the Internet
                are not available, especially in the least
                developed countries. Use of mobile
                phones also spawns a wealth of microenterprises,
                by providing such work as
                selling airtime on the streets and
                repairing or refurbishing handsets</li>

            <li>In Mali and other African countries,
                people used to travel from village to
                village to let friends and relatives know
                about weddings, births, and other
                events. This can now be avoided in
                areas with mobile phone coverage,
                which are usually more extensive than
                areas with just land-line penetration.</li>
            <li>The TV industry has recently started
                using mobile phones to drive live TV
                viewing through mobile apps,advertising, social TV, and mobile TV.[47]
                It is estimated that 86% of Americans
                use their mobile phone while watching
                TV.</li>
            <li>In some parts of the world, mobile
                phone sharing is common. Cell phone
                sharing is prevalent in urban India, as
                families and groups of friends often
                share one or more mobile phones
                among their members. There are
                obvious economic benefits, but often
                familial customs and traditional gender
                roles play a part.[48] It is common for a
                village to have access to only one
                mobile phone, perhaps owned by a
                teacher or missionary, which is available
                to all members of the village for
                necessary calls.</li>
